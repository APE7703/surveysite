For my final project I have created a survey creating/taking website that allows you to pose your queries to people on a topic of your wish and put any number of questions with atleast two options to other users who can then give back their results.
The choices are stored in a SQL database of four tables(users, surveys,questions,and options). They are linked to each other using common ids like taught in pset7.
Routes are similar to the ones done in the finance assignment with improvements here and there as required.

A couple of solutions I thought of myself that I am proud of:
    1. I came up with a way of discovering which button was clicked which I think increases efficiency
    2. The design of my database which was inspired but gave me a boost when I didn't know how to move forward

I have allowed for bootstrap's defualt styling as I am not much of a designer but I can vouch it doesn't look bad.

The project was tough and it took me quite a lot of time to get in the flow but by sticking to the idea I had in mind I believe I managed to learn more and overcome my limitations.
Lastly and most importantly I would like to thank Harvard and Professor David.J.Malan for their noble endeavour of promoting freer education.
